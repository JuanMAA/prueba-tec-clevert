This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment Variables Configuration

This project utilizes certain environment variables for its configuration. Below, you will find details on the necessary variables and their purposes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: This environment variable defines the endpoint for managing notes within the application. Ensure that you configure this variable correctly so that the application can interact with the notes API.

To configure these environment variables, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env.local` at the root of the project.

2. Open the `.env.local` file and define the environment variables as follows:

```markdown
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-notes-api.com/api
